# LoguxRails

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wilddima/logux_rails.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/wilddima/logux_rails) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/wilddima/logux_rails/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/wilddima/logux_rails?branch=master)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'logux_rails'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install logux_rails

## Usage

First of all, you have to configure logux, by defining server address in, for example, `config/initializers/logux.rb`:

```ruby
Logux.configuration do |config|
  config.logux_host = 'http://localhost:3333'
end
```

Mount logux in routes:

```ruby
  mount Logux::Engine => '/'
```

After this, POST requests to `/logux` will be processed by LoguxController. You can redefine it or inherit from, if it necessary, for example, for implementing custom authorization flow.

LoguxRails will try to find Action for the specific message from logux-server. For example, for `project/rename` action, you should define `Action::Project` class, inherited from `Logux::Action` base class, and implement `rename` method.

You can execute `rake logux:actions` to get the list of available action types, or `rake logux:channels` to get the list of available channels 

## Todo

- Add permit method to logux params
- Add specs matchers, with mocks for requests and so on.
